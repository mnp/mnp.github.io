	<ul>
	  <li>Most failures are learning opportunities: question your
	    assumptions, make new observations, and correct your
	    approach.  If you think you have rats but the rat trap
	    isn't working, find out what kind of animal you do have.

	  <li>Here is an idea said three different ways. You can be
	    smart enough to build something but not smart enough to
	    understand how it works. It seems that perfection is
	    attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when
	    there is nothing more to remove.  Any fool can write code
	    that a computer can understand, but good programmers write
	    code that humans can understand. These are all the same
	    idea, from Brian Kernighan, Antoine de Saint Exupery, and
	    Martin Fowler, but they apply to anything.

	  <li>Things usually go wrong in chains. If the dryer's drum
	  quits turning because the belt is worn out, why is it worn
	  out? The rollers have crumbled and heated the
	  belt. Why did the rollers crumble? Maybe their bearings
	  dried out. Keep asking why about anything, not dryers.

	  <li>Failing to plan is planning to fail.

	  <li>Learn from the mistakes of others. You won't live long
	  enough to make them all yourself.

	  <li>Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks
	    like work. -- Edison

	  <li>Whatever you are, be a good one. -- Lincoln

	  <li> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will
	    find strength. -- Marcus Aurelius

         <li>Anything perceived has a cause.
		All conclusions have premises.
		All effects have causes.
		All actions have motives.
		-- Arthur Schopenhauer

	 <li>The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in
	 mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function. -- F. Scott Fitzgerald
