	  <li>Most failures are learning opportunities: question your
	    assumptions, make new observations, and correct your
	    approach.  If you think you have rats and the rat trap
	    isn't working, find out what kind of animal you do have.

	  <li>Here is an idea said three different ways. You can be
	  smart enough to build something but not smart enough to
	  understand how it works. Make it as simple as possible but
	  no simpler. Any fool can write code that a computer can
	  understand, but good programmers write code that humans can
	  understand. These are all the same idea, from Brian Kernighan,
	  Einstein, and Martin Fowler.
